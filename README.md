## My personal Neovim Config

This repo is intended to give me a flexibility, compatibility, and mobility for my Neovim setup so I can have the setup everywhere.

Feel free to use, expand, and create your own.

### Usage
1. ( Recommended ) Backup your current Neovim
2. Run the command below in your Terminal

```shell
git clone https://github.com/risangbaskoro/nvim-config.git $HOME/.config/nvim
```

> What this command does is just clone this file to your `.config/nvim`
